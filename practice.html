									Civil law is the law of the state, law of the land, law of the lawyers and law courts. In
									measuring civil liability the law attaches more importance to the principal of
									compensation than to that of fault. It also does not take account of probable or intended
									consequences but only of the consequences, which actually ensue. The word civil is
									derived from ‘jus civile&#39; of roman.<br/>

									criminal laws where the state is involved. Civil Law is that body or branch of laws which
									every particular nation or state or city has established peculiarly for itself. The objective
									of civil law is to decide civil liability for an act or omission. Such liability is in various forms like damages, specific performance, compensation and various other segments like

									intervention of a third person (or more persons) but without recourse to a Court of Law.
									The settlement of dispute is arrived by the judgment of the third person (or more persons)
									who are called Arbitrators. The essence of arbitration is thus based upon the principle of
									keeping away the dispute from the ordinary Courts enabling the parties to substitute by a
									domestic tribunal. Conciliation is an informal process in which the conciliator (the third
									party) tries to bring the disputants to agreement. He does this by lowering tensions,
									improving communications, interpreting issues, providing technical assistance, exploring
									potential solutions and bringing about a negotiated settlement. Mediation is usually a
									voluntary process that results in a signed agreement which defines the future behaviour of
									the parties. The mediator uses a variety of skills and techniques to help the parties reach
									the settlement, but is not empowered to render a decision.

									As the term intellectual property relates to the creations of human mind and human intellect, this
									property is called Intellectual property. Creators can be given the right to prevent others from

									using their inventions, designs or other creations and to use that right to negotiate payment in
									return for others using them. These are Intellectual Property Rights.<br/>
									The creation of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) is increasingly being recognised in today’s
									global economy and society. The intellectual property rights are now not only being used as a
									tool to protect the creativity and generate revenue but also to build strategic alliances for the
									socio-economic and technological growth.<br/>
									The Convention establishing World Intellectual Property Organization, 1967 provides that the
									intellectual property shall include rights relating to: (i) literary, artistic and scientific works; (ii)
									performances of performing artists, phonograms and broadcasts; (iii) inventions in the field of
									human endeavour; (iv) scientific discoveries; (v) industrial designs; (vi) trademarks, service
									marks, commercial names and designations; (vii) protection against unfair competition; and all
									other rights resulting from intellectual activity in the industrial, scientific, literary or artistic
									fields.

									Criminal law in India means offenses against the state, it includes felonies and misdemeanors. The standard of proof for crimes is "beyond a reasonable doubt."<br/>
									Criminal law is governed by Indian Penal Code, Crpc, Evidence Act etc. The term criminal law means crimes that may establish punishments. Crimes are usually categorized as felonies or misdemeanors based on their nature and the maximum punishment that can be imposed. A felony involves serious misconduct that is punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year. Crimes that do not amount to felonies are misdemeanors or violations. A misdemeanor is misconduct for which the law prescribes punishment of no more than one year in prison. Lesser offenses, such as traffic and parking infractions, are often called violations and are considered a part of criminal law.

									Family Law is the branch of law, which touches each and every individual of the society. It governs an integral part of the life of the individual. In India we have a strange spectacle of personal laws. They owe their diversity to their varied origin, distinct principles and the bulk of substantive law itself. The personal laws play a vital role in governing the conflicting interest of the individuals.<br/> 

									Study of Family Law is Unique. It is not like the rest of the civil laws. It lacks uniformity in application. It covers an enormous area of domestic relations such as marriage, matrimonial remedies, legitimacy of children, custody, guardianship, adoption, intestate and testamentary succession etc. Family Law also deals with laws relating to Hindu Joint family, devolution of ancestral or coparcenaries property, succession to separate property of a Hindu and the Muslim law relating to gifts, wills and inheritance. The rules relating to marriage, matrimonial remedies, legitimacy of children, custody, guardianship, adoption is of immense importance as it involves the sensitive relationship between individuals in the society.

									Domestic violence is sadly a reality in Indian society, a truism. In the Indian patriarchal setup, it became an acceptable practice to abuse women. From a feminist standpoint, it could be said that the occurrence of domestic violence against women arises out of the patriarchal setup, the stereotyping of gender roles and the distribution of power, real or perceived, in society. <br/>
									For long, the fairer sex has suffered at the hands of men, the exploitation ranges from physical to intangible abuse like mental and psychological torture. Domestic violence is one of the gravest and the most pervasive human rights violation. For too long now, women have accepted it as their destiny or have just acquiescence their right to raise their voice, perhaps, because of the justice system or the lack of it or because they are vulnerable, scared of being ostracized by their own because domestic violence still remains a taboo for most women who suffer from it or for other reasons best known to them. But not any more! Women gear up-take control because of the domestic violence act, 2005.

									A Memorandum Of Understanding (‘MOU’) is generally a preliminary understanding between the parties to a contract, prior to the execution of a formal agreement. MOU is generally executed for creating consensus between the contracting parties for future contracts and is usually not intended to have created any obligations upon the parties. Primarily, what must be understood is that a MOU is non-binding and legally non-enforceable and is only an “agreement to agree” and highlights business relationship, which, are likely to result in some contract or any formal agreement between the parties. However, a MOU may create an obligation upon the parties if a binding understanding is inferred from the clauses of the MOU.<br/>
									In light of the above, it can be concluded that the enforceability and binding nature of a MOU depends upon the content, nature of agreement, language and intention of the parties to it. In cases wherein the MOU is in the nature of a contract and fulfills its essentials, it is held to be enforceable. A major factor to decide whether a MOU would be binding is the intention of parties while executing the MOU and their conduct post execution.
